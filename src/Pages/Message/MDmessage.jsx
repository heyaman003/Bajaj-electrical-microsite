      </p>
      <p className="n-t-p">
        Over the last year, we have continued to drive our strategic initiatives
        with positive outcomes. However, the industry has faced headwinds and as
        result, we have faced challenges on operational performance. As
        explained in the Chairman’s note, there has been significant pressure on
        mass consumption demand in the economy. Our total revenues from
        operations contracted from D4,889 crores (in 2022- 23) to D4,641 crores.
        Our Profit Before Tax contracted from D302 crores to D173 crores. Our
        PAT contracted from D216 crores to D132 crores. However, despite the
        pressures on margins, your Company generated strong cash flow from
        operations of D354 crores. Our Consumer Products segment contracted by
        4.3% during the reporting year, while the segmental PBIT contracted from
        D248 crores in 2022- 23 to D114 crores. Demand headwinds led to
        competitive discounting and thereby impacted margins. Our current
        dependence on mass segments and rural markets remains higher than
        industry, which have been under greater pressure. While general trade
        has faced challenges, we have witnessed pockets of growth across modern
        trade and online channels, as well as our premium brand, Morphy
        Richards. I am confident that 2024-25 should see us bounce back to
        revenue growth and margins bounce back. Our Lighting Solutions segment
        has performed relatively better. Although industry revenues were under
        pressure due to LED price erosion, we have been able to maintain our
        margins. The segment earned revenues of D1,037 crores, with segmental
        PBIT of D80 crores, representing a 7.7% margin (versus 7.8% margin in
        2022-23). Our focus on Lighting Solutions has led us to continually
        innovate and provide superior technological propositions. We are
        resisting the temptation to bid for low margin, low-end projects and
        focusing on moving up the value chain. Our sectorfocused solutions in
        Professional Lighting, are helping us build a quality order book that
        will drive our future growth. Similarly, in Consumer Lighting we are
        expanding our product portfolio and our distribution. We expect to start
        realising the benefits of this during 2024-25. Let me share a few
        operational updates. Brands: Last year I spoke about our new 'House of
        Brands' approach and, within that, the relaunch of the BAJAJ brand with
        the BUILT FOR LIFE positioning. The uplift in BAJAJ brand health scores
        are now visible, with greater ‘consideration’ scores and stronger
        association of BAJAJ with ‘durability’ across key product categories.
        Morphy Richards, on the back of its newer product range and
        communication, is witnessing wider appeal and sales growth. Nex, our new
        brand, was soft launched and has garnered positive early feedback from
        consumers as well as trade. Nirlep will see greater traction in 2024-25.
        I believe, this approach is setting the foundation for our growth in the
        future. As our refreshed brand communication builds up consistently over
        the coming few years, it will help establish strong, long-term brand
        salience and drive premiumisation of our portfolio. <br />
        <b>Products: </b>
        Over the past couple of years, we have clearly pivoted towards investing
        in research and development and established a product roadmap of
        exclusive products with innovative, consumer-centric propositions and a
        more optimised portfolio mix. During the previous year, we launched 467
        SKUs in the Consumer Products segment and 553 SKUs in the Lighting
        Solutions segment. We have been continually enhancing our product
        quality and aesthetics as part of our premiumisation shift. I am happy
        to report that we have achieved measurable success on this front; with
        our quality KPIs (as depicted by our consumer complaint statistics)
        showing significant improvement towards bestin-class, as well as winning
        design awards across product categories. Over 30% of our revenue
        contribution is now from our new products. As this contribution rapidly
        increases over the coming years, along with the consistent refreshed
        brand communication, I am confident that we will see a marked shift in
        our consumer perception, pricing power, and overall salience. <br />
        <b>Operations: </b>
        During the year under review, we have continued to roll out various
        initiatives across the organisation under our digital transformation
        programme, Project Nysa 2.0. Most of this will be fully launched and
        adopted by the end of 2024-25. This will provide the backbone for
        driving greater operational efficiencies and more informed
        decisionmaking. A couple of areas that we are working to improve have
        been our manufacturing and logistics capabilities. While these have
        impacted our performance, we have taken corrective measures during the
        current year to make amends.
        <br />
        <b>ESG: </b>
        We are advancing towards a sustainable future, underpinned by a
        strategic commitment to environmental stewardship and responsible
        business practices. With ISO 14001:2018 certified systems, we ensure
        stringent air quality monitoring and waste management based on the 4R
        principles, achieving Zero Waste to Landfill at our facilities. Our
        proactive energy management includes rooftop solar installations and
        energy-efficient technologies to effectively reduce our carbon
        footprint.
        <br />
        <b>People and culture:</b>
        Our people are central to our strategy. We remain committed to being a
        best-in-class organisation as a professional and preferred workplace.
        During the previous year, we were rated among the Top 25 Manufacturing
        Companies by the Great Place to Work Institute. We continue to invest in
        upgrading our talent pool. Some of our human resource initiatives are
        detailed in this report. <br />I remain grateful to our team for their
        belief in our vision and contributions to all the changes that we are
        driving to strengthen your Company. I would like to thank our Chairman,
        our Board, all our partners and you (our shareholders) for your
        continued support in our endeavours.
