      </p>
      <p className="n-t-p">
        I am writing to you for the first time following the culmination of the
        scheme of arrangement, wherein the EPC business has been spun off into a
        separate company, Bajel Projects Limited (listed in December 2023).
        Bajaj Electricals Limited is now focused on the Consumer Products and
        Lighting Solutions business segments, which marks the completion of a
        key milestone in our transformation journey. Operationally, the fiscal
        year 2023-24 has been a mixed year for your Company. This reflects the
        overall trends observed in the broader economy. The Indian GDP growth
        has been robust in the past year, but this has been primarily led by the
        infrastructure and select sectors, aided by strong government capital
        expenditure. On the consumption front, the premium segments and
        categories have been witnessing healthy demand, while mass consumption
        segments and demand from rural areas have been under pressure. A high
        interest rate environment, coupled with an uncertain job market, has
        contributed to this. <br />
        <ul>
          In this context, we have witnessed these trends play out in our
          businesses.
          <li className="list-outside list-disc">
            Our Consumer Products business has faced demand pressures. Our
            premium categories and segments as well as channels have witnessed
            growth. However, our dependence on mass segment products, rural
            markets and general trade channels is high and these have faced
            headwinds. I remain confident that with a pickup in consumption
            demand, our performance will bounce back
          </li>
          <li className="list-outside list-disc">
            Our Lighting Solutions business has fared relatively better. While
            there is an overall trend of LED price erosion, our order book for
            the Professional Lighting segment remains healthy. During the year,
            we executed several marquee projects, including lighting of the
            Mumbai Coastal Road tunnel, the airport at Ayodhya, the Golconda
            Fort in Hyderabad—each of these demonstrates our technological
            prowess in lighting. Our Consumer Lighting segment is poised to grow
            in the coming years.
          </li>
          <li className="list-outside list-disc">
            While the margins in the year gone by have been under pressure, we
            remain focused on driving longterm value-creation. To this end, we
            have continued to drive investments towards upgradation of our
            brands and products while maintaining uncompromised quality. During
            the year, we also soft-launched our new brand ‘Nex’—a premium brand
            offering . These are high-performance fans that are a testament to
            our R&D capabilities backed by sophisticated design.
          </li>
          <li className="list-outside list-disc">
            Our emphasis on financial discipline continues with a focus on
            working capital optimisation and continued strengthening of our
            balance sheet.
          </li>
          <li className="list-outside list-disc">
            Our commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
            commitment remains steadfast—in keeping with this, we have taken
            several initiatives to drive responsible growth which are detailed
            in this report.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        I would like to acknowledge our entire organisation and all members of
        our team for their contributions and perseverance. I remain grateful to
        all our business associates, our Board of Directors and to you, our
        shareholders, for continuing to back us.
        <br />
        Yours sincerely,
      </p>
