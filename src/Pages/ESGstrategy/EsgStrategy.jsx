      At Bajaj Electricals, we conduct a comprehensive materiality assessment that covers all our operational aspects. This approach provides us with a robust framework tailored to address Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors. Further, this strategy guides us in seamlessly embedding ESG considerations into our primary business operations; thereby facilitating the implementation of our future initiatives. We have four strategic pillars that underpin our ESG endeavours. These pillars, in turn, are reinforced by ten distinct focus areas.

           <span className='text-[10px]'>These pillars and focus areas collectively offer us a strong framework and precise guidance for efficiently integrating ESG factors into our daily business practices.</span>
